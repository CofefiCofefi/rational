# Rational Project - Seth Roberts

This project, called *Rational*, is a class designed to handle fractions and enforce the following invariants:

- The fraction must always be in its lowest terms.
- If the numerator is zero, the denominator must be one.
- The denominator must never be zero.
- Only the numerator should ever be a negative integer.

The project also involved writing tests for the class.

I referenced the notes published on the Canvas page, as well as some Stack Overflow discussions for syntax-related questions.

I introduced a few weaknesses and made things more difficult for myself in several ways. Firstly, my method of simplifying fractions was a bit overly complex, and I spent entirely too long figuring out how to make it work. Secondly, I wasn't very focused on keeping things organized and clean. If I had to come back and modify this code later, I would likely be frustrated with myself in a few spots.

However, I do think that my tests were more thorough this time around. I tried writing some of my test cases before actually writing the code I was testing, a technique I read about in my *Code Complete* book. I also feel that my naming scheme was fairly consistent and made sense, which Iâ€™m proud of.
